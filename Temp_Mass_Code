# PART 1 INTRODUCTION

## CHAPTER 1 PURPOSE, PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Code is to provide an international regulatory framework to address remote or autonomous operation of key functions and systems and ensure safe, secure, and environmentally sound operation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). The Code further aims to support the adoption and integration of new technology for ship operations and provide for consistency of approach to the design, build and operation of MASS.

### 1.2 Principles

This Code is developed on the principles that it be:

(a) supplementary to any other applied instruments, such as SOLAS, and only address MASS operations and functions as far as they are not adequately or fully addressed in the other applied instruments;

(b) holistic to ensure the objectives, aims and principles of the other applied instruments are maintained while also enabling the MASS operations and functions to be addressed across all instruments;

(c) goal-based and addressing matters at the functional level;

(d) non-mandatory although developed in such a way as to facilitate future transition to mandatory status; and

(e) technology neutral, acknowledging industry practices and experience in the deployment of new technologies.

### 1.3 Objectives

In achieving its Purpose, this Code is intended to:

(a) ensure standards of an acceptable level for design, construction, and operation and levels of safety and security expected of a conventional ship;

(b) enable all ships to safely coexist without impeding or negatively impacting each other, regardless of whether MASS operations or functions are remotely or autonomously operated;

(c) allow for the application of solutions that are demonstrably safe, secure, and environmentally sound in performing the designated MASS operations or functions under all defined conditions;

(d) avoid the unintended placement of regulatory barriers to new or novel application of remote control or autonomous technology on ships;

(e) require human oversight and control of MASS operations or functions while ensuring effective collaboration between human operators and autonomous systems; and

(f) address responsibility for the operation, and human oversight, of a MASS.

#### 5.5 Provisional MASS Certificate

Provisional MASS and MASS ROC Certificates may be issued to a ship and ROC that will enable initiation of operations while they are undergoing testing during step 3 of the approval process, as described in section 6.1 of chapter 6.

Provisional MASS and MASS ROC Certificates may be issued before performing the full-scale test of the ship and ROC, provided that individual MASS systems have been tested and verified and results of ship simulation (if applicable) are reviewed and accepted, in accordance with the verification and validation plan approved at step 2 of the approval process, and all the design documents have been updated accordingly and approved according to the simulation and system testing results.

Provisional MASS and MASS ROC Certificate[s] should be issued by the Administration or by an organization recognized by the Administration to a ship and ROC for a period and area of testing specified by the Administration, based on the arrangements proposed by the Submitter in the verification and validation plan.

In addition to surveys covered by the verification and validation plan, ships and ROCs issued with Provisional MASS and MASS ROC Certificate[s] should be subject to the surveys listed in 5.2 and 5.4, as appropriate.

#### 5.6 Validity of Certificates

**5.6.1** A certificate issued under section 5.1, 5.3 or 5.5 should cease to be valid in any of the following cases:
- .1 if the relevant surveys and inspections are not completed within the periods specified under section 5.2 or 5.4;
- .2 if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with the present requirements;
- .3 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new certificate should only be issued when the Administration issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of this Code.

**5.6.2** Where a MASS ROC Certificate is withdrawn or ceases to be valid, the Administration should review the effect on the associated MASS Certificate as well as on other MASS ROC Certificates issued for this ROC [by that Administration].

#### 5.7 Safety Management Certification

Every ISM company intending to operate a ship with autonomous or remotely operated functions should, in accordance with chapter 11 of this Code, develop its Safety Management System(SMS) to address MASS Operations, including Remote Operations.

The ISM company should ensure that the SMS is implemented and maintained on the ship and at any ROCs involved in its operation. The ISM company should clearly identify and document the subdivision of tasks and relationship between the ISM company and any associated ROCs and ships.

Any operational procedures specified by this code for the autonomous or remote operations, including watchkeeping arrangements, should be included in the safety management system of the ship and ROC respectively.

The operation of the ROC, including the remote operation of the ship, should be included in the ISM verification and certification process for an ISM company to the satisfaction of the Administration.

Where the alternative management described in section 11.[...] is used for the operation of a ROC(s), certification should follow a similar approach as the ISM Code with:
- .1 a ROC Safety Management System (ROCSMS);
- .2 a DoC for the Remote Operation Management(ROM) Company (ROM DoC); and
- .3 a ROC Management Certificate (RMC) for each ROC.

#### 5.8 ISPS Certification

A ship or ROC to which this code applies, should be certified according to the ISPS Code, as supplemented by this Code.

#### 5.9 Minimum Safe Manning Documents

A ship to which this Code applies should be furnished with a Minimum Safe Manning Document (MSMD) according to IMO resolution A.1047(27) as amended, and to the satisfaction of the Administration.

A ROC operating a ship to which this Code applies should be furnished with a Minimum Safe Manning Document (MSMD) for operation of that ship, based on the principles of IMO resolution A.1047(27) as amended, and to the satisfaction of the Administration.

A ROC operating several ships should be issued with one MSMD per ship. For such ROCs a MASS ROC Master Plan (MRMP) for watchkeeping and other tasks should be developed and approved by all Administrations who have issued MSMDs covered by the MRMP.

Ships and the ROCs involved in their operation should be manned in accordance with the respective MSMDs.

### CHAPTER 6: APPROVAL PROCESS

#### 6.1 Process description

A structured approval process should take place to enable the MASS to obtain the required approval including the necessary certificates related to requirements for the intended operation. By following this process, Submitters and Administrations would be working in cooperation to ensure that all aspects of safety, security and environmental protection are adequately assessed. This process is intended for the MASS as a whole, while individual systems are covered in the verification and validation step.

The approval process for MASS should be based on and follow the main principles of the Guidelines for the approval of alternatives and equivalents as provided for in various IMO instruments (MSC.1/Circ.1455) taking into consideration parts 2 and 3 of this Code. The level of detail should be proportional to the complexity, level of novelty and associated risk of the MASS and on whether the Submitter is applying for preliminary or final approval and the necessary documentation may vary accordingly.

The steps and documentation required in this chapter provide the general basis of the approval process. This does not exclude other information or documentation that may be requested by the Administration or an alternative process which may be followed to the satisfaction of the Administration.

Sufficient information should be supplied to enable the Administration to fully assess the features of the MASS. After appropriate identification of relevant stakeholders by the Submitter, discussions should commence at the earliest possible stage so that the Administration may fully evaluate the level of safety of the MASS.

The approval process should be conducted using the following steps:
1. Preliminary design development;
2. Preliminary design approval;
3. Testing, simulation, and other verification methods;
4. Final approval; and
5. Operation.

#### 6.2 Evaluation criteria

The basic principle for the evaluation criteria should be to ensure a level of safety, environmental protection and security that is expected of a conventionally operated ship. The evaluation criteria should be developed through compliance with the goals and functional requirements of part 3 of this Code in combination with a risk assessment (as described in 7.2 of the Code). The evaluation criteria and an assessment plan thereof should be agreed with the Administration.

#### 6.3 Design and documentation requirements

For each approval step, information and documentation required by the Administration should be produced and submitted. The various documents required in the approval process steps are expected to be reviewed according to any possible design or operational changes and added details. The approval steps do not need to be sequential, meaning that they may also run at the same time.

The ConOps (as described in section 8.2) should be a base document in the approval process and should be the basis for the assessment in each step.

#### 6.4 Operation

Conditions for maintaining the safety level agreed during the design approval may be imposed on ship operation. Any operational conditions should be determined during the approval process, and they should be clearly documented and communicated to relevant parties.

If, during the operational phase, the initial assumptions, systems and equipment are changed, i.e. any change in the ConOps, the part of the risk assessment with the respective changes should be repeated. The extent of work needed will be dependent on the risk-based features, the changes and the operation of the ship and may be decided by the Administration.

For example, in the case of a ROC with remote operators approved for the control of one vessel, it may be necessary to review the approval assumptions if a second vessel is added to the same ROC.

MASS may initiate operations while it is being tested. During such tests, the certification of the ship should follow the process for Provisional MASS Certification described in section 5.5. In addition, further mitigation layers to the system that is being tested should be foreseen such as different modes of operation from the ones of the final design.

Table 1 in the annex provides additional guidance in relation to the approval steps that require relevant documentation.

### CHAPTER 7: RISK ASSESSMENT

**7.1** A risk assessment should be conducted to ensure that risks arising from the use of MASS functions, including relevant functions in ROCs, affecting persons on board, the environment, and the safety of the ship are addressed, taking into account identified goals and functional requirements, ensuring a level of safety expected of a conventional ship. The risk assessment can be conducted on MASS as a whole, and/or on the MASS functions. It should also consider the OE or ConOps of the MASS. The risk assessment should address relevant mitigation measures. Should the risk assessment be carried out on specific MASS functions, the consequences on other ship's functions should be considered and mitigated.

**7.2** Appropriate risk assessment methodologies¹ should be used for the different steps of the approval process as required in chapter 6 (approval process). Such risk assessments might include but are not limited to:
- .1 MASS (including ROCs) and system design;
- .2 alteration or modification of any major characteristic of the ship or of the OE or ConOps of MASS that may impact MASS functions.

**7.3** A risk assessment should be carried out by personnel with relevant expertise as required by the Administration of the flag State (MSC.1/Circ.1212/Rev.2, annex, point 4).

**7.4** Risks should be analysed using suitable, recognized and appropriate risk assessment methodologies. The output format should be justified by the Submitter and be agreed between the Submitter and the Administration. Risk assessment should include a comprehensive description of the autonomous and remote-control function's utilization, effectiveness and reliability by performing a thorough hazard and mitigation analysis, evaluating the identified risks, and implementing effective risk control measures. The risk assessment should analyse and address hazards associated with the intended OE of the MASS including the associated ROCs, as described in the ConOps. Apart from the hazards such as loss of function, cyber incidents, software application failure, component damage, fire, explosion and electric shock, it should also consider the random, systematic, and systemic hazards involved within the OE.

**7.5** The adopted mitigation measures should take into consideration single failure events, but also foreseeable events within the OE of the ship that may influence the performance of more than one system at the same time (e.g. heavy weather during hours of darkness). Such features should consist mainly of independent mitigation layers, including predefined fallback states. The number of such mitigation layers should be proportional to the risk.

The assessment should ensure that hazards are eliminated wherever possible through inherently safe design and hazards that cannot be eliminated should be mitigated as needed.

The effectiveness of the mitigation measures considered in the risk assessment should be verified according to the verification and validation plan stipulated in paragraph 2.7 of the annex.

### CHAPTER 8: OPERATIONAL CONTEXT

**8.1** The operational context for a MASS should, within the applicable regulatory framework, and on the understanding that it does not have any privilege over conventional ships, consider all aspects of the MASS operation and describe the autonomous or remotely operated ship function(s) and the external environment that influences its operation.

The operational context encompasses the Concept of Operation (ConOps), the Operational Envelope (OE), the system-specific Operational Design Domain (ODD), Fallback States, the Mode(s) of Operation (MoO) and the Human control and supervision, all of which should be considered as part of the certification.

#### 8.2 Concept of Operation (ConOps)

**8.2.1** The ConOps should be drafted to ensure the safe, secure and environmentally friendly operation of the ship.

**8.2.2** The ConOps may be drawn up in a form corresponding to the model given in appendix [NN] to this code or an alternative acceptable to the Administration.

**8.2.3** Risk assessments for the ship and ROC should take the ConOps into consideration. The ConOps and the associated risk assessment should ensure that all relevant risks are addressed.

**8.2.4** The ConOps should include consideration of the Operational Envelope (OE) and the technical design of the ship and of the Remote Operation Centre(s) (ROC), if applicable, including connectivity and communication lines. The ConOps should address the control, monitoring, and intervention on board the ship and at the ROC, if applicable, together with the integration of humans in the operation.

**8.2.5** The ConOps should be reevaluated when there are hardware, software, operational or management changes to the ship or ROC.

#### 8.3 Operational Envelope (OE) and Operational Design Domain (ODD)

A ship to which this Code applies should have a clearly defined OE for the ship as an integrated system, which also includes the ODDs of all relevant ship systems or functions.

##### 8.3.1 Operational Envelope (OE)

The Operational Envelope (OE) of the ship should encompass the operational capabilities and limitations of the autonomous or remote operation, and ship-specific capabilities and limitations to indicate the condition in which an autonomous or remotely operated ship can operate safely in all operating conditions, including all reasonably foreseeable degraded states.

The OE should (inter alia) contain:
- .1 the definition of the ship functions and states and its use case(s);
- .2 the geographic area of operations, including coverage/connectivity and traffic conditions;
- .3 the description of the environmental limitations;
- .4 the description of operational limitations for different modes of operation during a single voyage;
- .5 the use and management of the modes of operation, including the division of functions and allocation of tasks between humans and automation; and
- .6 any other factors that have a significant impact on MASS operations.

##### 8.3.2 Operational Design Domain (ODD)

The Operational Design Domain (ODD) of individual functions or systems should be based on the results of a risk assessment. The relevant design documents should include:
- .1 the conditions and limitations under which any relevant individual autonomous or remotely operated system or function operates safely;
- .2 reasonably foreseeable system or equipment malfunctions including corresponding degraded states;
- .3 the extent of human interaction;
- .4 the capabilities and limitations to be accomplished before activation of operation of the individual system or function; and
- .5 descriptions of the external and internal conditions, such as geographical boundaries within which the ship is to operate, the maximum wind and sea wave heights, etc.

An autonomous or remotely operated system and related equipment should operate within its ODD and should be able to detect whether its current state of operation meets the ODD.

##### 8.3.3 Degraded state

A single autonomous or remotely operated system or function deviating from its ODD should not necessarily result in the ship deviating from its OE. As long as the ship as an integrated system can continue to be operated within its OE the deviation of an autonomous or remotely operated system or function from its ODD should be considered as a degraded state.

#### 8.4 Fallback state

In case of deviating from its OE a ship should enter a predefined fallback state, offering an additional mitigation layer. There may be more than one predefined fallback state to address failures or conditions identified at the ship design stage that might lead to a ship deviating from its OE.

The conditions, actions and procedure to enter into, and recover from, a fallback state should be considered as the fallback response and should be predefined and able to be tested.

When a ship enters a fallback state, the predefined fallback response should avoid, as far as practicable, any harm to life at sea, other ships, infrastructure, or the marine environment while the ship returns into its OE and normal operation is restored.

Fallback states should be risk-assessed and demonstrate effectiveness in avoiding further deterioration in the status of the ship or increases in the threat to life at sea, other ships, infrastructure, or the marine environment. Depending on the result of the risk assessment, more than one independent fallback state should be available at any time during normal operations. Being in a fallback state should not result in an intolerable risk.

The ship should be capable of notifying its crew and any operators when transitioning to, and operating in, a fallback state.

#### 8.5 Contingency plans

A deviation from an OE beyond a predefined fallback state, should lead to the activation of contingency plan(s).

#### 8.6 Mode(s) of Operation (MoO)

The MoO of a ship may be changed for different phases of a voyage, and procedures to change from one MoO to another, along with the criteria for any such change, should be described in the ConOps.

The description of MoO should also identify:
- .1 which ship functions are autonomous or remotely operated;
- .2 how autonomous or remotely operated ship functions are allocated to different agents (human or software);
- .3 how the affected ship functions are supervised, and by which agents;
- .4 where the different agents are located (on board or remote); and
- .5 which other systems and other roles (personnel) are involved in performing the control action.

#### 8.7 Human Control and Supervision

Humans should be able to exercise control, if the situation requires it.

[There should be a human master responsible for a MASS, regardless of mode of operation [and the master of the MASS should have the means to intervene when necessary].]

Identification of systems and personnel involved in performing control actions as per 8.6 should be based on the understanding that operation of a ship without any human interaction has limitations.

The remote operator or onboard crew should be provided ample time and sufficient information to be able to establish situational awareness, assume responsibility and exercise direct or supervisory control of all functions according to the ConOps.

### CHAPTER 9: SYSTEM DESIGN

In addition to complying with relevant rules and regulations and standards, performing and supervising any specific function of the ship, MASS functions should comply with the following high-level principles.

#### 9.1 Safety-Centric Design

Systems should be designed to minimize risks to the ship, crew, ROC operators, cargo, other ships and the marine environment by incorporating inherently safe design principles. All systems used for MASS operations should include fail-safe mechanisms and emergency protocols to ensure comprehensive safety and effective risk management. Hazards affecting the systems should be eliminated wherever possible, and those that cannot be eliminated should be mitigated as needed by using a risk assessment as described in chapter 7.

#### 9.2 Human Centred Design

[The design and operation of the MASS and associated (ROC) human-machine interfaces should prioritize assistance to human operators. The Human-Centred Design (HCD) should be appropriately tailored for all anticipated interactions between the crew/operators and the MASS.

Interactions between onboard crew and remote operators should be considered in the Human-Centred Design outlined in section 13.6.

Human operators, both on board and in remote, should be actively involved in the validation stages to ensure that the systems can be safely operated.]

#### 9.3 Robustness and Reliability

- .1 Systems should be robust and should be able to operate effectively under adverse conditions, including diverse maritime environments and operational challenges.
- .2 It should be ensured that the systems perform their required functions effectively during the operational period specified by the manufacturer, up to predetermined maintenance intervals.

#### 9.4 Adaptability and Flexibility

Systems should have the ability to adapt to changing environments, tasks, and user requirements, and allow for updates and modifications to accommodate necessary technical and regulatory updates, and future needs.

#### 9.5 Redundancy and Fault Tolerance

- .1 redundant sub-systems should be implemented to maintain functionality in case of component failures including systemic or systematic failures.
- .2 Systems should be designed to handle and recover from failures and continue operating at a reduced performance level (fallback state).

#### 9.6 Scalability

It should be ensured that systems design are scalable, allowing for expansion or updates as technology advances or operational needs change.

#### 9.7 Security and Cybersecurity

Security measures to protect the systems on the MASS and the ROC should be incorporated to prevent unauthorized access and cyber risks.

#### 9.8 Data Management and Quality

Efficient data management systems should be incorporated to ensure data accuracy, integrity, and quality.

#### 9.8bis Proper Record Keeping (Data Logging)

**9.8bis.1** Systems should support data logging for performance, failure and incident analysis.*

*footnote: MCS.333(90) "Adoption of revised performance standards for shipborne Voyage Data Recorder (VDRs)"
IEC 61996-1:2013+A1:2021 "Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems - Shipborne voyage data recorder (VDR) - Part 1: Performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results"

**9.8bis.2** Data should be electronically stored for a predetermined period, minimum 30 days, and be made available in an appropriate format*.

*footnote: MSC.1/Circ.1024 "Guidelines on voyage data recorder (VDR) ownership and recovery"

**9.8bis.3** For data stored on board, means should be available to protect data during, and retrieve data following an incident.

**9.8bis.4** Logged data should contain appropriate detail to restore a complete record of the MASS operations, including, where applicable, remote operations and automated decision-making processes.

**9.8bis.5** Logged data should be made available to the Administration and other marine investigation authorities upon request.

**9.8bis.6** The requirements of SOLAS regulation V/20 (VDR carriage) should apply to all MASS to which this Code applies.

#### 9.9 Interoperability

Compatibility and interoperability with systems, devices, applications, and technologies should be ensured.

#### 9.10 Testing and Validation

MASS systems should undergo comprehensive testing and validation to ensure compliance with design specifications and operational requirements. This process includes a structured, procedure comprising detailed simulation, component testing, integration testing, system testing.

Operators should be actively involved in the system validation phase in real-case scenarios to ensure practical usability and operational soundness meeting all regulatory requirements, before obtaining the necessary certifications.

#### 9.11 Transparent Design

Ensure that transparency is maintained in the system design for systems operations and decision-making processes.

### CHAPTER 10: SOFTWARE PRINCIPLES

The following principles should be implemented to ensure that software on or supporting MASS (or automated functions thereof) are reliable, trustworthy, safe and secure. They should be used within the context of complying with the MASS Code, including the use of remote control and autonomous operation of key functions.

The principles should be considered as part of the approval process, and this may be done using software quality assurance standards.²

#### 10.1 Proportionality

Software should have an explicit and well-defined operational design domain. The use of software should not go beyond what is provided for in the ConOps and risk assessment(s) should be used to prevent hazards which may result from such uses.

#### 10.1bis Reliability

The continued effectiveness of such software capabilities should be subject to testing and assurance across their entire lifecycles.

#### 10.2 Safety and Security

Unwanted harm (safety risks) as well as vulnerabilities to external factors (security risks) should be avoided and addressed. Safety and security (including cybersecurity) risks should be identified, addressed, and mitigated throughout the software's operational life to prevent and/or limit, any potential or actual harm to shipping, humans, or the environment.

#### 10.3 Transparency and Explainability

Software should be transparent and explainable at all stages of its operational life, and for all decision-making processes. The transparency and explainability should ensure relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology, development processes, and operational methods applicable to autonomous capabilities, including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and design procedure and documentation.

#### 10.4 Accountability

Entities developing, deploying, or operating software should implement mechanisms to ensure accountability and proper operation of their software. Software should be auditable and traceable to such entities. There should be governance mechanisms in place for oversight, impact assessment, audit, and due diligence to ensure accountability for the software's impact throughout its operational life.

#### 10.5 Robustness

Safe and secure software and hardware should be enabled through robust frameworks. Software should perform consistently with intended objectives, in a stable and resilient manner in a variety of circumstances. The robustness of such systems should be tested and assured across their entire life cycle within that domain of use.

#### 10.6 Human Oversight and Determination

Software should be designed and developed to ensure people managing MASS operations can exercise appropriate oversight, including the ability to verify decisions when required. Humans should be provided with the means to interpret appropriate context, prevent or minimize risks, provide input and direction as required for safe, secure, and environmental sound operation of MASS.

#### 10.6bis Unintended Bias

Software should be designed and developed to prevent unintended bias.

### CHAPTER 11: MANAGEMENT OF SAFE OPERATIONS

#### 11.1 Goal

The goal of this chapter is to ensure adequate management for safe operations.

#### 11.2 Functional Requirements

To achieve the above-mentioned goal, the ship, the company and the ROC should comply with the requirements for the management for the safe operation of ships in SOLAS and the ISM Code, as supplemented by the functional requirements of this chapter.

**11.2.1** The Safety Management System (SMS) should provide for safe MASS operations by establishment of procedures, plans and instructions for all foreseeable modes of operation, including those involving different physical locations, if applicable.

EP 1 Risk control measures should address autonomous or remotely controlled ship functions.

EP 2 Internal processes verifying the effectiveness of procedures, plans and instructions should address autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions.

EP 3 Human-machine-interface aspects of autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions.

EP 4 role and expected performance for all physical location(s) where autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions are executed.

EP 5 With respect to autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions, the following should be considered:
- .1 their interaction, capabilities and limitations;
- .2 the complexity of systems, including software systems or data services;
- .3 equipment and systems necessary to maintain contact to the MASS.
- .4 lines of communication to maintain contact to the MASS;
- .5 cyber-risks; and
- .6 fallback actions and processes to maintain their safe operation

**11.2.2** The Safety Management System (SMS) of the company should provide for the safety and well-being of the personnel involved in the operations by:
- .1 identification of resources and training required; and
- .2 establishment of procedures, plans and instructions for all foreseeable operating conditions of the ship, including those involving different physical locations, if applicable.

EP 1 This will be accomplished by ensuring consideration of:
- .1 risk control measures addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;
- .2 internal processes verifying the effectiveness of procedures, plans and instructions addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;
- .3 human-machine-interface aspects of autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;

- .5 how to maintain function of overriding authority; and
- .6 emotional pressure, specific stresses and strains to humans in the MASS operations.

**11.2.3** The Safety Management System (SMS) of the company should provide for the safety of the ship under all expected emergency conditions by establishment of contingency procedures, plans and instructions, including emergency scenarios involving different physical locations, if applicable.

EP 1 This will be accomplished by ensuring consideration of:
- .1 risk control measures addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;
- .2 internal processes verifying the effectiveness of procedures, plans and instructions addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;
- .3 human-machine-interface aspects of autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions;

- .9 addressing cyber risks during emergencies addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions; and
- .10 means and procedures for emergency standby arrangements and equipment addressing autonomous or remote-controlled ship functions.

EP 2 This emergency procedures should be executed based on predefined contingency plans and adjusted appropriately as needed.
- .1 An appropriate Mode of Operation (MoO) should be adopted, including suspension of operations if necessary.
- .2 Emergency response data and relevant information should be accessible at any location involved in the response.
- .3 All resources from the ship and the Remote Operations Centre (ROC) should be promptly mobilized to address the emergency situations.

#### 11.3 Alternative Management for the Safe Operation of the ROC

With regard to a company operating one or multiple Remote Operation Centre(s) (Remote Operation Management(ROM) company), this company could, to the satisfaction of the Administration, establish a Safety Management System for the operation of those ROCs under their responsibility. This ROC Safety Management System (ROCSMS) should supplement the ship's SMS developed by the ISM company, and the MASS ROC Certificate clearly establishing the relationship between the SMS and ROCSMS, to ensure that the safety level of the ship established through the ship's SMS is maintained.

The alternative ROM certification should follow a similar approach as the ISM Code with:
- .1 a ROC Safety Management System (ROCSMS);
- .2 a DoC for the ROM Company (ROM DoC); and
- .3 a ROC Management Certificate (RMC) for each ROC.

### CHAPTER 14: ALERT MANAGEMENT

#### 14.1 Goal

The goal of alert management is to enhance the monitoring, handling, distribution, and presentation of alerts for ship and ROC thereby allowing for the prompt identification and addressing of any alert situation that arises and ensuring safe operation.

#### 14.2 Functional Requirements

To achieve the above-mentioned goal, the following functional requirements which are supplementary to SOLAS requirements are embodied in this chapter.

FR 1 An alert management optimization should be performed taking into account the ConOps so that the alert management provides:
- .1 the means used to draw the attention of the remote and onboard crew to the existence of alert situations;
- .2 the means to enable the human operator to identify and evaluate the situation and handle alert announcements;
- .3 the means for MASS remote and onboard crew and relevant third parties to assess the urgency of different alerts in cases where more than one alert must be handled;
- .4 the means to manage alerts in a distributed system structure in a consistent manner; and
- .5 support for effective supervision of autonomous and remotely operated functions.

#### 14.3 Expected Performance

EP 1 Alerting should follow the basic principles of the Bridge Alert Management (BAM) concept outlined by MSC.302(87), as amended.

EP 2 If practicable, there should be no more than one alert for one situation that requires attention.

EP 3 Alerts should provide information for the operator to sufficiently understand the consequences of the situation and determine appropriate actions.

EP 4 The alert management should handle alerts from all systems or components required to support MASS and ROC operation in accordance with performance standards adopted by the Organization. Furthermore, it should have the capability to handle all other alerts in a consistent manner.

EP 5 The logical architecture of the alert management and the handling concept for alerts should provide the capability to minimize the number of alerts, especially those on a high priority level.

EP 6 The master should receive alerts and have access to the alert management at all times. The operator responsible for the MASS should be able to directly handle the alert management Human Machine Interface (HMI). It should be possible to provide the central alert management HMI at the control position for the operator.

EP 7 Audible alerts should guide human operators to the task stations or displays which are directly assigned to the function generating the alert and presenting upon request at least the cause of the announcement and related information for decision support, e.g., dangerous target alarms should appear and have to be acknowledged at the workstation where the collision avoidance function is provided.

EP 8 As alerts can be displayed at several locations and task stations, the system should be consistent as far as practicable with respect to how alerts are presented, silenced and acknowledged at any one task station. Actions taken in a task station should be visible to all other relevant task stations.

EP 9 In addition to relevant alerts associated with conventional ships, specific consideration should be given to those alerts related to the operations and functions to which this Code is applied, as outlined in other chapters. Examples of such alerts would include but not be limited to:
- .1 upon entering a fallback state or upon recognizing the need to enter a fallback state;
- .2 in case the MASS is not able to enter a fallback state when deviating from its operational envelope;
- .3 in case of equipment failure affecting operations of MASS functions or significantly increasing the risk of MASS operation e.g. loss of redundancy;
- .4 in case a system, that is critical to MASS operation, exceeds or is about to exceed its ODD; and
- .5 in case of ROC-specific alerts and conditions requiring attention (e.g. power failures, task station failures, communication system failures at ROC-level, software failures at ROC-level).

EP 10 Alerts should only be presented for handling (e.g., acknowledgement or silencing) at task station(s) used by the operator in charge of the tasks related to the initiated alerts. Alerts may be presented visually for information at other task stations.

EP 11 Task stations presenting alerts for multiple MASS should have the means to organize alerts per MASS and have the means to delegate alert handing for selected MASS to another task station.

EP 12 When an emergency alarm is activated, a sufficient number of dedicated human operators including the master of the MASS should be operating the MASS until the emergency is over.

EP 13 The observation of abnormal situations and conditions concerning more than one MASS should be classified as alarms.

### CHAPTER 16: MAINTENANCE

The goal of this chapter is to ensure remotely operated and autonomous systems can be safely maintained, tested and inspected to ensure their reliability.

**16.1** Maintenance of remotely controlled or autonomous systems should not result in unsafe events. This should include:
- .1 systems should be able to be safely isolated and verified prior to commencing maintenance; and
